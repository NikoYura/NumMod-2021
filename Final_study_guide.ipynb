    "For the midterm you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finite differences (FD)\n",
    "    - write down basic FD approximations to differential operators, equations, and boundary/initial conditions\n",
    "    - determine the order of approximation (and prove)\n",
    "    - judge whether an initial-value problem is stable (or for what parameters it is stable)\n",
    "    - understand how to implement FD on a computer\n",
    "2. Finite elements (FE)\n",
    "    - fomulate a (boundary-value problem for a) PDE in a weak form\n",
    "    - formulate a FE problem, finite element space (piecewise linear functions)\n",
    "    - write down the stiffness matrix in simple cases\n",
    "    - understand how to implement FE on a computer\n",
    "3. Spectral methods (new compared to the Midterm study guide)\n",
    "    * for a given (steady of time-dependent) PDE problem, formulate the corresponding spectral method (with bases including sines, cosines, complex exponentials)\n",
    "    - understand how to implement a spectral method on a computer\n",
    "4. Interpolation, quadrature\n",
    "    - given an interval and interpolation nodes, write down a formula for a polynomial interpolation of a function\n",
    "    - given the nodes of a quadrature formula, write down the quadrature formula\n",
    "    - given an interpolation or quadrature, determine its (convergence) order"
